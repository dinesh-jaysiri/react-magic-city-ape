#### Purpose
Magic-City-Ape is an NFT minting decentralized application that aims to provide a seamless and secure platform for users to mint and purchase NFTs. The dApp includes presale and public sale minting and smart contract functionality, including the ability to pause and reveal the contract.

#### Key Features
Presale and public sale minting functionality
Payment splitter included in the smart contract
Integration with MetaMask for a seamless user experience
Hardhat used for developing smart contracts
React used for building the front-end interface

#### Technologies Used
Hardhat for developing smart contracts
React for building the front-end interface
MetaMask for integrating with the Ethereum network

#### Results
Magic-City-Ape provides a secure and transparent platform for users to mint and purchase NFTs. The integration with MetaMask ensures that users can interact with the platform seamlessly, while the payment splitter functionality included in the smart contract ensures that funds are distributed fairly.

#### Challenges & Solutions
One of the main challenges in building an NFT minting dApp is ensuring the security and transparency of transactions. This was achieved by utilizing Hardhat for developing smart contracts and integrating with MetaMask for a seamless user experience. The payment splitter functionality was also included in the smart contract to ensure that funds are distributed fairly.









## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
